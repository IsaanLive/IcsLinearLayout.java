A simple extension of a regular linear layout that supports the divider API  of Android 4.0+. The dividers are added adjacent to the children by changing  their layout params. If you need to rely on the margins which fall in the  same orientation as the layout you should wrap the child in a simple  {@link android.widget.FrameLayout} so it can receive the margin.
